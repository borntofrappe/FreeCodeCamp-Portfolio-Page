# Preface 

As for the previous repository, this project is tasked with the fulfillment of a challenge for the new freeCodeCamp curriculum. In particular, for the responsive web development certification.

This time around, the project regards a portfolio page, in which to showcase a few projects and forward toward platforms like github or freeCodeCamp. 

I previously created a portfolio for the now legacy certification, with bootstrap.

Moreover, I am in the process of building a shining new portfolio page on github pages, for my personal page.

With this in mind, I planned two of many things:

1. the project should not rely on CSS frameworks
1. the project should be shipped rather rapidly, to strictly fulfill the specified the user stories.

This last point doesn't entail a lack of care in the project. I will undoubtedly spend an inane amount of time on the style, colors and fonts for the page. It is a simple, natural consequence of the simple fact that this is not my final portfolio page.


### User Stories

The page should have:

- [x] a welcome section with `id="welcome-section"`. The section itself should nest an `h1` element. The section should also occupy the entire viewport;
- [x] a project section with `id="projects"`, nesting at least one element with `class="project-title"`, at least one link to a project;
- [x] a navbar with `id="navbar"`, nesting at least one link forwarding toward a different section of the page. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport;
- [x] a link with `id="profile-link"` opening a github or freeCodeCamp account, in a new tab;
- [x] at least a media query.
